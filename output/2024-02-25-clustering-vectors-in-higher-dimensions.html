            <h1>Clustering vectors in higher dimensions</h1>
            <p>2024-02-25</p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Determine whether we can understand which are the concepts in a delimited portion of high-dimensional space.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>We are analyzing a corpus of 600k sentences from the Asian Development Bank public documents.
These documents have been split into sentences and vectorized using the OpenAI word embeddings API.
The resulting vectors, along with the sentence text and the paper uid, have been stored in a table called sentencev.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>We select a random point in the space. We compute the closest points in this vector space to constritute a sub-corpus.
We compute the frequency of words in the sub-corpus. We evaluate the effectiveness of the process.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible, using L2 distance, to get a list of the closest sentences to a given sentence, even in high dimensions space.
For research purposes, we arbitrally chose a distance of 0.1 as the threshold for similarity.
Experimental analysis of the L2 distance in pgvector shows that the distance between a vector and itself is 0. All other vectors have a distance greater than 0.5.
Visual inspection confirms that the sentences are semantically close, even at the bigger distances (ie. 0.1).
The sentences are scattered across a set of papers, which is expected.
The word frequency over the corpus, once the stopwords have been disposed, shows that the most frequent words across the corpus capture the semantics of the sentences.
The performances of the L2 distance algorithm can be improved.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Cluster all the points in the vector space.
Randomly choose a point in the space, not yet categorized.
Analyze the distribution of points in the clusters. Determine the number of clusters. Determine a threshold below which it is not worth to continue the clusterization.</p>

<p>"The train program aims to employ workers and enhance their skills through education and job training. It provides information to women about work opportunities, targeting at least 175 labor sector companies. The survey shows an increase in people attending school across the country. The report and baseline data indicate that participants at all levels, including the self-employed, formal graduates, and those in the industry, have seen improvements over the years. Higher education, especially in the 10-base system, also figures prominently in the development of employees. Learning opportunities for the high workforce, families, and the self-employed are provided in households. TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) has received a significant share of attention, with 78 occupations covered. 20 businesses and firms are actively involved in the program."</p>
