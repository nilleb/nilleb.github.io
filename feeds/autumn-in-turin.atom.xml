&lt;p&gt;a new season begins today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I felt this sensation, it was early morning. The clouds were slowly moving above Turin, along their path towards Milan. They were a clean-cut border between the light and the shadow, between the summer and the fall. Strange colours shaded the landscape, and the same clouds were undistinguishable from the tops of the mountains. At the opposite corner of the sky, the sun was rising, spreading its light over the land. Along its daily path, in the next few hours it would have been folded by the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait the end of this afternoon, which will came at 5pm. Just in time to see the last lights of today. I love the golden hour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="autumn-in-turin"></category></entry></feed>
