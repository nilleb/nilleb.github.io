            <p>2007-12-04</p>
            <p>I have to thank <a href="www.davidesaglietti.it">Davide</a> for <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2424-9595_22-177729.html">this article</a>. Without him I would simply have lost this <em>fuzzize(_funny</em>)_ list of disasters.</p>
<p>Private joke: I hope that flycanard(no links available, sorry) doesn't contain such problems, and that it isn't used in certain production environmen <a href="void(0)" title="petitflycanard"></a>ts... (atomic plants, defense systems, and so on).</p>

<p>update: today I've changed links, added a picture and published this new <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3gkbc_compil-hilarious-bad-day-at-the-off">link</a>, which I find very related to this post</p>
