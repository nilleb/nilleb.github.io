..about what's the destiny of these blogs.  
right this evening I have heard a news about Facebook, who's using its users information to make money.  
well, I'm pretty scared about this. about one month ago I've moved my official blog on a third party server. Now, I wouldn't like to know that this third party's using my personal information.  
I'd like to use this blog as a personal diary, to record what's happening all around. Thus, this evening I am concerned not about the existence of this diary, but about its public-ness.  
who knows? you can as well leave a comment. I will surely read it.  
  
seeya.
