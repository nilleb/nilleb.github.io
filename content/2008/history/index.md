[Obama claims Democratic nomination](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/03/AR2008060300888.html?hpid=topnews)

ok, the first African American to claim the right to be the Democratic candidate for the next USA presidential elections. yes, he could be wrong, and the Democratic party could refuse him his right (as it happened to some candidate in the 80s).

I hope US have changed since the 60s ([ยง1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination), [ยง2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_assassination),[ยง3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._assassination)), and that the last [nobel prize winner](http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=7&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F10%2F11%2Fworld%2F11cnd-nobel.html%3F_r%3D1%26hp%26oref%3Dslogin&ei=u4VGSL_dA4Tg1wbN792yBg&usg=AFQjCNEvPopouoXBkoXym0_IaSGeUiLJdw&sig2=xN8hM2xsoXkxDHzxhVT2UA) (Doris Lessing) is clearly [wrong](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/obama-would-be-killed-780703.html).

I'm however happy to see that history is being written...
