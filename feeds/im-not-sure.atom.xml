&lt;p&gt;..about what's the destiny of these blogs. right this evening I have heard a news about Facebook, who's using its users information to make money. well, I'm pretty scared about this. about one month ago I've moved my official blog on a third party server. Now, I wouldn't like to know that this third party's using my personal information. I'd like to use this blog as a personal diary, to record what's happening all around. Thus, this evening I am concerned not about the existence of this diary, but about its public-ness. who knows? you can as well leave a comment. I will surely read it.&lt;/p&gt;
