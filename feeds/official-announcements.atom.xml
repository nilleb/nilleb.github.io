&lt;p&gt;I am surely not a public company or an international organization. Nevertheless, I have some official announcements to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am going to move in France. I will be there since January, 1st, 2007. More or less precisely, since so many things are on the move …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surely not a public company or an international organization. Nevertheless, I have some official announcements to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am going to move in France. I will be there since January, 1st, 2007. More or less precisely, since so many things are on the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I have resigned from my current work. Since the same January 1st I will be free! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we have found an home in Lyon. It will be in the 7th arrondissement, not far from Jean Macé place. No more informations are released publicly.. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I will work for Esker Software, a software publisher present in many countries but still small. I say this not despite their hopes, but because I think that this enterprise is still at a human-being dimension. My freedom will end on January, 15th :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all. Enough, for this Wednesday.. :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="official-announcements"></category></entry></feed>
