Coming back to the office after the lunch, I can read the following news:  
Amazon is launching a [wireless e-ink book](http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-33292511@7-37,0.html?xtor=RSS-3208), named kindle. Amazon currently allows all users to download an excerpt of the sold books (90000, according to A.). Well, I think this could be a great Christmas present. Sony's doing (or has done) the same thing.  
Mozilla foundation is releasing [Firefox 3 beta 1](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/).  
Some news, good news indeed!
