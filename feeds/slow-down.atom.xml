&lt;p&gt;I've not wrote anymore a lot on this blog, and I suppose that its time has quietly flown. You'd rather follow me on twitter (@nilleb). In 2011 I'll quit my employer, getting a new job elsewhere. It looks very interesting, I can't wait starting over in the new position. I'd like to greet my ex colleagues, wishing them all the best, and thanking a lot of people about their availability and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks go also to those who have read this blog giving a feedback. Feedback will always be precious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="slow-down"></category></entry></feed>
