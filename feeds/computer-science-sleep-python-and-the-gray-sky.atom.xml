&lt;p&gt;Office temperature got 27 degrees this afternoon. Thanks Benoit, we are now getting some fresher air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stand developers who still put sleep()s in their code to manage interprocess communication. Because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* there are so many other ways to manage the communication among processes * it is not sure. we think we've got it, but we will haven't it. (it? the recipient of the communication, at the other end of the cable!) * it's a matter of faith, rather than a good programming practice. I do not believe. * a (not so) loved professor told me once (waving his battle axe with both hands) that it's not worth doing such things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, during a Windows Vista installation (god, help us!) I had some time to read some documents about python and perl. I'm evaluating the possibility to use them in my work, and I think that I will love Python, despite its scary name. Perhaps for its better aesthetics. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="computer-science-sleep-python-and-the-gray-sky"></category></entry></feed>
