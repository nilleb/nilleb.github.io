shiny thing, this [miro](http://www.getmiro.com/).  
I'd like to try it. perhaps in the next days.  
  
what about today? a cold day. the snow begins to fall over the hexagone.  
  
personal appointment: the yearly rendez vous with my chef. I don't really know what this should define and help.  
 but it does exist. well, now it's passed. perhaps, in the next months an 'augmentation' will follow. I continue to learn SAP, and to move on small projects. Something like a Tun re-branding and a Bragardlish web application. let's hope well.  
  
[arte](http://www.arte.tv/fr/70.html) this evening transmits an afraiding reportage about the Great War. it could be a good signal to start the miro installation.  
  
  
bonne soirée.
