            <p>2007-12-07</p>
            <p>today I have had the chance to read an old post from Ambra. In its <a href="http://www.grunig.eu/SensibleSensitivity/2006/11/24/cerco-amy/">post</a> (in italian), she writes about an author. Her name is Amy Hempel, and <a href="http://www.pifmagazine.com/SID/413/">one</a> of its short novels is published on the net. I find this wondeful: a community of writers publishing some of their pieces on an accessible-by-everyone medium. (<a href="http://www.pifmagazine.com/TID/">http://www.pifmagazine.com/TID/)</a></p>
<p>About this new generation phenomenon, I can add a link towards the <a href="http://www.wumingfoundation.com/">wumingfoundation</a>, a group of italian writers who publish their works via a classic medium and through the internet. Their works are published by Einaudi (one of the most famous and respected editor in Italy). But a copy of their works is always available on their site. Miracles of copyleft. Now, you only have to search them (accessing the wuming site, see above for the link).</p>
<p>In facts, as I write, and as I read their site, I discover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_%28footballer%29#Blissett_and_the_.22Luther_Blissett_Project.22">Luther Blissett Project</a>. Named after a 80es footballer name, that's bizarre! :-)</p>
<p>And what about the discovery of the wuming group? That's more bizarre, yet. I was reading a french traduction of an interview they released to the Guardian.co.uk...</p>
<p>That's why I am amazed by the noise<a href="http://ibellinsalarin.blogspot.com/">.</a></p>
