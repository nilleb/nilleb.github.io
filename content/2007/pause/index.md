I'm waiting for a Windows 2008 RC1. but all the people (IT pros) are out for lunch and I cannot get a blank DVD.  
  
somebody (phil) has put on a slow and crying blues. it feels the emptiness of life (without a Windows 2008 RC1).  
  
well, jokes apart, I'm now setting up a VMware image to start testing without a real DVD. they (producers) should start to imagine computers with emulated drives, starting form an ISO image.  
  
and what about windows 2008 signature for drivers? if a driver signature is not good for you, it won't boot. well, in this case, a F8 at the boot of your computer will be a panacea (placebo) for your driver signature yelling feature.
