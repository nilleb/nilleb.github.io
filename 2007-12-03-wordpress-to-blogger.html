            <p>I'd change to blogspot/blogger if I was able to. Apparently, it seems a bit more complicated (and it takes a little more) than exporting/importing with a four step procedure. Somebody has written personal, hard-coded tools. But it seems that it isn't possible to preserve original comments properties, with such instruments. It is maybe a limitation in the google blog API. Thus, no way. I have postponed the migration, for now.</p>
