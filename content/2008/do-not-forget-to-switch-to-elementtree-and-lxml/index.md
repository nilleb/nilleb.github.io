[pyXML is dead](http://www.nabble.com/PyXML-for-py-2.5-to13477754.html), as shown in this thread (http://www.nabble.com/PyXML-for-py-2.5-to13477754.html) so, do not forget to switch to more recent implementations, supported on Python2.5. for example, [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/, or http://codespeak.net/lxml/) or [ElementTree](http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm) (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm, or http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree)
