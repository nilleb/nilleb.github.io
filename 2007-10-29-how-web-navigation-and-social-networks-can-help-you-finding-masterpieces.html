            <h1>How web navigation and social networks can help you finding masterpieces</h1>
            <p>2007-10-29</p>
            <p>This morning, taking a random look at <a href="http://del.icio.us/ian.b.sparrow">del.icio.us</a>, I found a bookmark that a friend had sent to me. It included a link towards an AD web page about a <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.pdf">good book</a>. Reading some of its pages I have found a link towards its appendices.. And I have been caught by the (really) strange title of the Appendix C.</p>
<p>This appendix is a copy of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=506636+517178+/usr/local/www/db/text/1999/freebsd-hackers/19991003.freebsd-hackers">an email message</a>.</p>
<p>I have found this reading so worth that now I want to spread its knowledge all around the world. I have put back this link to the friend who told me about the book, and also to every other person I know on del.icio.us. Further and final step, my blog.</p>
<p>I think that this link will remember you some particular mailing list you've been on for some time. Well, this happened to me. Now, I regret not having found this email message some months ago.</p>
<p>As "Ingénieur tests développement", I find the idea about the messages prompted to the user on (email) message reply very funny. Moreover, they could help socialization among final users. --------- That's all folks! :-)</p>
