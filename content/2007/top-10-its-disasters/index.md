I have to thank [Davide](www.davidesaglietti.it) for [this article](http://news.zdnet.com/2424-9595_22-177729.html). Without him I would simply have lost this _fuzzize(_funny_)_ list of disasters.

Private joke: I hope that flycanard(no links available, sorry) doesn't contain such problems, and that it isn't used in certain production environmen [](void(0) "petitflycanard")ts... (atomic plants, defense systems, and so on).

update: today I've changed links, added a picture and published this new [link](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3gkbc_compil-hilarious-bad-day-at-the-off ), which I find very related to this post
