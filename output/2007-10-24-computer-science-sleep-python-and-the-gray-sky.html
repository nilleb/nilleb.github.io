            <h1>Computer Science: sleep(), python and the gray sky</h1>
            <p>2007-10-24</p>
            <p>Office temperature got 27 degrees this afternoon. Thanks Benoit, we are now getting some fresher air.</p>
<p>I cannot stand developers who still put sleep()s in their code to manage interprocess communication. Because:</p>
<p>* there are so many other ways to manage the communication among processes * it is not sure. we think we've got it, but we will haven't it. (it? the recipient of the communication, at the other end of the cable!) * it's a matter of faith, rather than a good programming practice. I do not believe. * a (not so) loved professor told me once (waving his battle axe with both hands) that it's not worth doing such things</p>
<p>This morning, during a Windows Vista installation (god, help us!) I had some time to read some documents about python and perl. I'm evaluating the possibility to use them in my work, and I think that I will love Python, despite its scary name. Perhaps for its better aesthetics. ;-)</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
