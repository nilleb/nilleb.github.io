wow, the next release of docmgr is really unstable, currently.  
normal, we are about one year before the final release.  
  
note for the ones who will follow: it's better to add your sap host to the %systemroot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file before trying to connect the sap connector  
another one: the current setup doesn't include the Custom folder and its content, in the SAP connector package.
