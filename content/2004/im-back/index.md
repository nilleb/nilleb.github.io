yeah, sure. I'm back. summertime travelling's over and right now I'm putting my hands on old work that has to be completed. sometimes I cannot stop recalling Ireland and Marche. These were great holidays, I loved specially Ireland. I only promised to be back, to see what I haven't seen yet. And there are a lot of things to see :-) I'm searching for someone who wants to come with me on my next trip to Ireland, so if you like to travel and you want to see it.. -- right now I'm upgrading shinywhite to the last ~ppc Gentoo. there are a lot of problems with it, I should warn lu\_zero. then I'll study Linguaggi&Traduttori (a compiler construction lecture at Polito). then somewhen in the future we'll start a project probably called cowmilk. I'll let you know more about this one.

bye bye, my friend :-)
