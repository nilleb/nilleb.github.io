We're on the move.

We have reserved the flight, and rented the car.

We want to go back to Ireland.

I haven't realized that until the last week. I didn't really want to go to Ireland, in my unconscious part. I couldn't understand why. Why to return in a country I have already visited twice?

Then I remembered. I remembered the colors of Ireland. The people. The pleasure of taking a photo, the feeling of the wind,Â  the taste of the Irish Guinness.

Then I realized. I realized that I will be leaving for Galway, for the Connemara, for the Mayo and Sligo counties, for Howth and Malahide, for Tara and the interior of the Ireland.

oh, Ireland! :-)
