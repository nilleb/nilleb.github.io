&lt;p&gt;some days ago I received an email from a friend. she asked me to add her contact to my friends list on last.fm. it was since some years that I didn't use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, I have been happy to discover it again, even if the site interface is not so easy to browse (not so intuitive, I'd rather say).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from a technical point of view, the traffic sent on the network is not so much, and the server transmission port is always the 80/HTTP. So, it's rather difficult to get blocked by some firewall/proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from a music fan point of view, it is a good radio. on this radio I can choose what to hear, and somebody has filled an huge database about artist similarities, so even when I do not know the name of the group, I can still find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in social networking, sometimes. I'm still waiting for a recommendation, but till now I have discovered so many known people on the network that I'm however happy about knowing their musical preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ianbsparrow is my nickname, in the case you choose to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="lastfm"></category></entry></feed>
