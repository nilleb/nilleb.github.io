            <h1>Slow down</h1>
            <p>2010-12-27</p>
            <p>2010 has been a great year, very rich in good news.</p>
<p>I've not wrote anymore a lot on this blog, and I suppose that its time has quietly flown. You'd rather follow me on twitter (@nilleb). In 2011 I'll quit my employer, getting a new job elsewhere. It looks very interesting, I can't wait starting over in the new position. I'd like to greet my ex colleagues, wishing them all the best, and thanking a lot of people about their availability and knowledge.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go also to those who have read this blog giving a feedback. Feedback will always be precious.</p>
