the spam comments began to grow up in number: a wordpress upgrade was required. I'm happy with this software, even if it's a bit heavy for this site. It's also a long time I do not write on this page, since I haven't been able to find some time to do that.

I have put up another site, called friends. It is useful for some friend I met at the University. We still remain in touch, also if we live across (at least) two countries. It is not accessible for public use, since engineers are privacy fanatics. However, I hope it will be useful to express opinions and to manage votes... :-)

Now I'm going, I have finished my free time.
