Browsing digg, I have arrived to this interesting page:

[http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away\_with\_words/2007/12/the-ikea-naming.html](http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2007/12/the-ikea-naming.html "Where the IKEA furniture names come from")

It's amazing,Â  what we can do with words. It's like magic :-)
