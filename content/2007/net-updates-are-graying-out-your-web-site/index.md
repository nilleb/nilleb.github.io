do you have updates since a few seconds/minutes/hours your .net platform?  
or are you obtaining "page not found" error for a web site that you're sure it was working yesterday evening?  
well, the first thing you've to try is to go to the IIS manager, and take a look at the Web Services extensions. Are they enabled? All the ones required by your web site?  
  
be careful to enable ONLY the ones you need, otherwise you can open gates to malicious users!
