2010 has been a great year, very rich in good news.

I've not wrote anymore a lot on this blog, and I suppose that its time has quietly flown. You'd rather follow me on twitter (@nilleb). In 2011 I'll quit my employer, getting a new job elsewhere. It looks very interesting, I can't wait starting over in the new position. I'd like to greet my ex colleagues, wishing them all the best, and thanking a lot of people about their availability and knowledge.

Huge thanks go also to those who have read this blog giving a feedback. Feedback will always be precious.
