once upon a time, Olympic games where a good reason to stop wars.

once upon 1896, the Baron de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee. I think he did this in order to give the Mankind a good reason to stop wars each four years again.

But, after a few years we were already able to ascertain that wars were stronger than Olympic Games (Berlin 1916, drop off).

We discovered that Olympic Games were inattentive to human rights and dictatorships (Berlin 1936).

And in recent times, we discovered that Olympic Games started to be a little more attentive to human rights (Rome 1960, Mexico City 1972). But nevertheless ready to go on when it's the case of some people killed during the games (Munich 1972). 'the show must go on', hein?

So, what's new about the 2008 Beijing Olympic games?

(I think I have showed up -in this post- a great amount of ignorance and inattentiveness about history. but I have done it conscientiously[](http://dictionary.sensagent.com/conscientiously/en-en/)).
